        <p>Liangban(凉拌)  is a chinese sauce usually used in salads or appetizers, but can be used on much more. 
            a savory, sweet, and salt sauce, it is perfect over many different types of vegetables, meats, and even 
            simply over rice. It is a easy recipe that only requires mixing of ingredients and a brief blanch of mushrooms. The hardest part is 
            probably getting all the different types of sauces.

        <ul>

            <li>Mince the garlic</li>
            <li>Chop the cilantro, but reserve half for later</li>

            <li>Thoroughly rinse the Mu’er. If you Mu’er aren’t quite bite sized, rip into 2-3 pieces. (it may take multiple rinses if your mushrooms are especially sandy)</li>
            <li>Blanch the mu’er in boiling water for 2 minutes. After blanching, either rinse under running water or toss in a pot of cool water to stop the cooking process.</li>
